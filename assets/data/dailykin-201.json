This is where your deepest roots receive true nourishment. Red Dragon is the energy of form contained within the formlessness of the primordial sea.Primal trust means making choices with no guarantees, knowing that divine nurturance will provide what is needed for your journey. It means making choices moment by moment, implicitly trusting your innate steering mechanism of heart-knowing. Primal trust implies surrendering to the will of the divine self, letting go of what your ego deems to be control of the outcomes in your life. It means deeply trusting the processes that are at work within your present spiral of evolution.","The energy of Red Dragon asks you to embrace the depth of your receptivity. Perhaps you have been taught that it is better to give than to receive. Giving is a powerful way to learn how to receive, but it is not the whole picture. There is a circuit of completion in giving and receiving that happens within you and in your external world at the same time. If you trust unconditionally in the giving, you are not attached to how the gift is received. When you freely give, you fill your cup with sweet waters, which you can then offern innocently and purely to another. Know, on one level, that your gift is poured out universally regardless of how it appears to be received. However, when the gift comes from the ego, it is limited by expectations and conditions. Love just is. It is neither given nor taken; rather it is simply discovered and allowed.","The universe is an inseparable whole. Red Dragon represents the energy matrix lines that look like a web in the universe, through which all points are connected in time and space. This energetic web of communication is known as the 'crystal grid network.' It is a cauldron of creation, a potent field in which all things are not only possible but constantly being created. Within this grid, the linear causality of time and space has been freed into an open system in which all time and all space exist and interact simultaneously. This grid connects the larger holograms of reality with our own. Its energy lines connect all places, times and events - even those that are seemingly unrelated. All phenomena and all actions are part of this larger whole; it is the very foundation for telepathy and synchronicity. Red Dragon embodies unity, in which all things are one with the Source. Red Dragon is also your Higher Self & Guide. You are a double Red Dragon. When your Conscious Self and Higher Self are one and the same it means that you desire to embody all that Red Dragon is, completely and powerfully. Your SuperConscious is guiding you to trust in the larger pattern to provide what you need. Communicate your feelings, desires and dreams!","Yellow Sun is your Subconscious Self and Hidden Helper.Yellow Sun is a reminder that you are, at every moment, in the center of All That Is. In your journey of remembrance, you are crafting a light body to return to a home in the stars that you never really left. Return as a child of the sacred to the Great Central Sun! You are the crown of creation, infused with the blueprint of solar mind. You are a Godseed, the reflection of cosmic consciousness. You are love made visible!","Discover the simple secret encoded in Ahau's star-glyph: you are unconditional love, the stone of indestructible liberation. Radiate that knowing in all your thoughts and actions. Love all of creation. Join the dance of light, the fundamental constant of nature, and shine forth the clarity of your true essence. There is great power in simply identifying with the light: \"As above, so below.\" You are in God, and God is in you.","As you express unconditional love, you become more than you previously perceived yourself to be. You become illumined, the full manifestation of your divinity. In the embrace of your humanity, accept yourself and others unconditionally. Magnify your full presence. Ahau will come in myriad forms to assist you. Be limitless. Accept and understand the nature of judgement, fear, light and dark within yourself and others. Love and accept yourself and others as you are, freed from previous boundaries. You are the dawning of the solar age.","As you move toward your core of light, you will find a clear-light awareness that is innately innocent. In this place, the mind is restored to it's original state of receptivity. Clarity and freedom become expressions of being, and bliss becomes the body. At this core of light, a new reality is born. From the union of the divine masculine and feminine is birthed the solar androgyny of cosmic consciousness.","Blue Monkey represents your Challenge and Gift. With maturity and awareness this challenge will turn into a Focus. This is what you desire to learn in this lifetime.There are many facets to Blue Monkey's shadow. The most common of these is not seeing the humour in life's experiences. If you take life too seriously, humour may offer the relief of an unexpected point of view. Follow your divine child, and you will be shown how to \"play\" your way through any apparently difficult situation. Humour is a great healer and teacher, and a wonderful way to lighten up about enlightenment.","Another prominent shadow of Blue Monkey is avoiding speaking your truth. Do you use humour to express things that you are afraid to say to someone honestly and directly? Do you use humour to hide your vulnerability? Perhaps you use sarcasm because you feel wounded, insecure or unable to express your deep feelings. Such use of humour is a way to bring out hidden anger or aggression. If you find yourself caught in inappropriate play, consciously step out of it and bring in the missing awareness.","Trust your magical child to be vulnerable. Express your feelings - especially your awkwardness - in a direct way. Let go of using pretense or humour as means of masking your true feelings. Like the divine child you are, allow all emotions to be OK, and freely express them without judgement.","The issue of sensitivity also lies in the shadows of Blue Monkey. Perhaps your inner child was unthinkingly wounded or suppressed by social expectation. Perhaps your gift of sensitivity was not supported by parental figures or the culture at large. In order to protect yourself from this criticism, you may have withdrawn, supprssed your self-expression and creativity, or become absorbed in fantasy worlds. Honestly examine any dynsfunctional, hidden reactions or set patterns you may have that resulted from such woundings. Transform this shadow by becoming aware of your emotional reactions and perceptions of insensitivity. Then express the feelings around it before you get too deeply enmeshed in the cycle of emotional reaction.","In Western culture, many people have a distorted understanding about what it is to be a human being. We are often taught that successful adults are responsible, serious, rigid, controlled, and goal oriented. In your journey with society, your developmental stages may have been incomplete. The natural sensitivity, fluidity and freedom of the child may have been left behind in partial passage. Perhaps your inner child was wounded or treated insensitively, and you carried this unresolved process into adulthood. Blue Monkey encourages you to bring forth this incomplete or wounded part for integration and healing.","This process implies a bounteous connection between Essence Self and Spirit, freed from judgement, denial and separation. It encourages an unconstrained experience of feelings, living your dreams and visions, where everything is sacred and so, by nature, humourous and joyful. Live your dreams! The moment is now. In this co-creative process, your life literally becomes a work of art and the dawning of the new myth.","In this new myth, your spontaneous, divine child will usher in and anchor the new frequency. How can you heal your inner child? Explore what truly gives you joy. Find types of work that support your sensitivity and create deep satisfaction. Be simple: love, play, dance, draw, colour, sing. These activities are for all divine children - they serve the expression of the magical child in everyone. Consciously make time for the joyful freedom and magic of play!","White Mirror is your Compliment - something that comes naturally to you. White Mirror represents the Hall of Mirrors, where you can face your own reflection and see the truth about yourself. As a mirror, White Mirror merely reflects what is, whether truth, beauty or illusion. Here you can face unfinished business, the dissonance of difficulties, or charged issues that would keep you from the full expression of your Divinity. Become aware of any illusions or distortions within yourself; your clarity of perception will transform them. Take a moment to see yourself as you actually are, shadow and all, freed from the maze of mental illusion.","Sometimes you may find yourself reacting rather than freely responding to a situation or person. If you have charged reactions such as frustration, anger, fear, judgement or jealousy, look at how you might be projecting these issues onto someone else. The world is the mirror for you to truly see. Any strong reaction to a person or event signals an issue to work on in yourself. Be willing to examine and utilize what you see in your mirrors, in order to transform dysfunctional belief systems, negative thoughtforms, and fixed patterns.","In the Hall of Mirrors there is no good or bad, no right or wrong - there is only the reflection of what is. As you learn to see yourself, you begin to see your emotional reactions as signs indicating where to focus your awareness for growth.","On this quest, come prepared to face White Mirror's sword of truth and purification. The wisdom of this sword penetrates, exposes, and ultimately heals your illusions. Discrimination is tempered with love cleanly cuts away everything that does not serve your evolution. To the Maya, White Mirror is the flint that hones your sword.","The greatest gift of the sword is the power of forgiveness. A profound freedom emerges from forgiveness, the releasing of the illusion of cause and effect. Use the great gifts offered in this blad of truth and light to forgive and release anything you may judge or see as imperfect.","You are already an Enlightened Being!","White Mirror's are able to clearly reflect others back to themselves once their own mirror is clear.","Your Tone is Tone 6 - RhythmicReceptivity, ability to respond, dynamic equilibrium, roots in many directions.Six is the ray of organic balance, the dynamic equilibrium of the foundation of self combined with the one point of unity. Organic balance is an active process, not a static or fixed state. It is rooted in teh totality of who you are. Let your receptive roots run deep, grounding your ability to respond in this world. Bring your Essence Self into your present expression. Aliveness is derived from essence.","You are the unity that creats organic balance. You are free to choose, respond, give, and receive. Six asks you to respond to life with love, to bring heaven to Earth (*anacronym for Heart!) through your embodiment of the six-pointed star. Embody the Divine in your organic form. As you are infused with the vibration of heave, heaven is brought to Earth. As you journey homeward, Earth is brough to heaven. Thus is created organic balance, heaven and Earth in symbiotic union."]},"calendar":{"galactic":"27","guided":"Birth","moon":{"image":"https://spacestationplaza.com/images/moons/moon_new.gif","name":"New Moon","percent":"0.7%"}}}
