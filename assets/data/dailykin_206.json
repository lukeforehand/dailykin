    "White World-Bridger is your Conscious Self - who you are and who you are becoming.In this life-time you are being asked to release and surrender. Surrender is the opposite of giving up. It is freeing yourself from the desire to be in control, letting go of how you think things should be. Surrender is freedom. You are being invited to release yourself from the bondage of preconceived action, to let everything be all right as it is, so that you can live a more inspired life in the moment!\r",
    "You are being asked to take action in the process of surrender and release. You are requested to die a symbolic death, to surrender your limiting beliefs. Symbolic death unveils the self by cutting away the outgrown parts of yourself that no longer serve you. In such death, ego structures fall away to reveal the garden of the true self. Look for new ways of being, new people, new ideas, and new directions that will move into the vacuum created through surrender and release. Like yeast, surrender enlivens and empowers you to experience more of life's fullness.\r",
    "Holding on to past patterns and grievances only limits the possibilities. Forgive yourself. Forgive others. Let go. Surrender whatever limits you. Face whatever you are resisting. In the experience of any loss, it is never too late to complete. Through your willingness to walk in the dark forest, insights and revelations will naturally emerge.\r",
    "White World-Bridger is also your Higher Self & Guide. (you are guided by your own power doubled)White World-Bridger teaches you to let go and be. It represents the death of outgrown parts of the small self, which can be used as fodder or fuel for the regeneration into a more expanded self. The energy that is generated from the transfromation of these parts creates a refinement of your spirit. Also, by burning off the dross of the small self, a vacuum is created, drawing new people, ideas, and directions into your life.\r",
    "In the past, an old behaviour or belief system may have created a way for you to temporarily fel better about yourself by supporting your ego structure. As that ego structure is burned off, you create a pathway for Spirit to fully satisfy the same needs. Through your willingness to walk in the dark forest, the gifts of insight and revelation are provided.\r",
    "Accept the truth of your present situation. Through accepting what is, you are free to go forward. Change and growth become easier and more natural. Each experience in this enlivened state of surrender allows for more joy.\r",
    "The colour for White World-Bridger is forest green. You, like the symbol of the evergreen tree, are alive and green amidst the process of apparent death and trans formation of winter. Green creates a feeling of balance and restful calm. It is restorative and healing, grounding, and centering. If you wish to access the power of White World-Bridger, visualize forest green. \r",
    "Blue Eagle is your Subconscious Self and Hidden Helper.\r",
    "Blue Eagle reminds you to step powerfully into your commitment as a planetary server! Your assignment includes whatever furthers your personal evolution and the evolution of global mind. You are an awakener, a transformer, an empowered gloal visionary. In your vision, you have compassion for others, and your decisions are made in the light of global consciousness. Ask yourself how you might experience compassion toward self, the Earth, and others. Be guided towards types of work, relationships, places to live, and projects that will benefit the Earth and her creatures. Allow your spirit to expand. Soar on your spreading wings and planetary perspective. Affirm: \"Through your, Gaia, I am also transformed! I am awakening as the return of divine love and light. We are all one. Gaia, as you awaken, I heal myself. As I awaken, you are healed, and together our petals open ecstatically to the new Sun of Flowers.\" \r",
    "It is up to each one of us to hold a positive vision and affirmation, for the means by which this miracle will occur is through changes in the one affecting the greater whole.\r",
    "Imagine the profound impact your loving thoughts have on planetary mind. You do make a difference! As you connect individually with the larger crystal grid network, your power is multiplied exponentially. This galactic grid is also known as the Mayan cobweb.\r",
    "The greatest gift you can offer to the planet is to simply be the love. Believe in yourself and your dreams and visions! Remember your special gifts, your path of service on Earth, your promise to serve the light. Everything you are connects to the greater whole. You are starseeded! You have the vision of the eagle. Believe in your dreams. You are the hope and the vision revealed.\r",
    "Yellow Warrior represents your Challenge and Gift. With maturity and awareness this challenge will turn into a Focus. This is what you desire to learn in this lifetime.A major shadow of Yellow Warrior is a lack of trust in your inner voice. Oftentimes, in listening for the roar of a lion, you may not perceive the more subtle messages given by Spirit. Divine communication directs transformations on a cellular level, outside the realm of cognition. Self-doubt and fear are blocks to such trust. By creating electrochemical charges and holographic residue in your system, they can block access to cosmic communication. Your true self is always in direct contact with cosmic consciousness. Trust in your ability to receive clear inner teaching.\r",
    "The transformation offered in the shadow of Yellow Warrior is found in releasing and healing these blockages. Start by simply claiming your birthright of guidance from Spirit - and thus your union with cosmic consciousness. If you sense that you have a block, or if you lose this connection, lift and clear yourself. Call on your divine connection and your self-authority in meditation or prayer. Claim your own healing. You will be guided toward self-forgiveness and integration. The ferryman offers you clear passage to direct guidance. Trust in your mystical intelligence and inner knowing.\r",
    "Some people call this inner knowing a \"spiritual steering mechanism\", and it can appear in many forms. The most common is a sense of confirmation, a strong sensation or rush, the \"touch of Spirit.\" Another is subtle body movements or specific sensations in which energy is directed through the autonomic nervous system. In this case, when the message is received, the body responds with an involuntary movement, a vibration, a feeling. Some people may have a feeling of warmth in their heart or solar plexus. Others may hear tones or voices or see lights, colours, patterns, or images. Still others may receive feedings of insight or energy, or \"knowings\" that are confirmed again and again. Any one of these means may become part of your own spiritual compass. Pay attention to these subtle messages. You know when something rings true and when it does not.Attune yourself to the vibration of love, and your clear intent will attract the cosmic consciousness you seek.\r",
    "Red Skywalker is your Compliment - something that comes naturally to you.Red Skywalker is the skywalker, the time/space traveller who can jump dimensions to assist you in realizing heaven on Earth. RS is unlimited in form but often chooses the form of the angelic messenger.\r",
    "A person who embodies cosmic wisdom may be known as a sky-walker, sage or bodhisattva. When others see such light in human form, they feel the vibration of heaven. This vibration may be embodied by you or experienced with a guru, master, an energy such as Red Skywalker, or in a 'chance' encounter with an extraordinary person.\r",
    "An encounter with the energy of Red Skywalker can spark a deep yearning within you for reunion with the Source. Yet from this place of love and compassion, you also have a desire (embodied in physical form) to serve the light. This is the place in you that has the courage to fully express unconditional love, the depths of your being. Red Skywalker asks you to live the new myth by bringing this heaven to Earth in your daily life. As this reality is lived, it touches and awakens the same truth in others: \"They kingdom come, Thy will be done, on Earth as it is in heaven.\"\r",
    "Red Skywalker represents balance in your life - not static balance, but a dynamic equilibrium that includes both your present expression and your starseeded self. In Red Skywalker's star-glyph you see that the pillars of heaven don't appear to touch the Earth. You are the element that appears to be missing in the star-glyph. You are the one whose expression of the light assists in drawing the pillars of heaven to Earth.\r",
    "Joining these pillars in yourself can be viewed as reuniting your male and female aspects. Together, in balance, we create the pillars of the etheric temples of heaven on Earth.\r",
    "The natural state of every system moves toward balance that is fluid and free, as in dance. That balance is experienced differently by each person, but it often brings a sense of steadiness or centeredness even in the midst of movement and change. When you are dancing, you can use your very state of imbalance to create the fluidity of the dance. \r",
    "Your Tone is Tone 11 - Spectral Change, disintegration, letting go, stripping away, complexity moving to simplicity.Eleven is the ray of dissonance, the foundation of self combined with the foundation of Essence Self, catalyzed by the point of unity. Eleven is the process of disintegration, stripping away the layers down to your core essence. Unity, the great illuminator, is transforming patterns and structures, freeing you from things that no longer serve your emerging wholeness. Look through the surface appearance of your process. Let complexity dissipate, becoming the blessing of simplicity.With the Spectral Tone of 11, cherished ideals, beliefs, and images of all kinds are being brought up for you to reexamine, illuminate, and transform. Examine what appears dissonant in your life. Let go! Embrace the disintegration process without resisiting or judging it. The rigid walls of your resistances are being broken down. Going through your resistances and boundaries prepares a space for greater wisdom. You are becoming an open system. Anything that defines you is being stripped away. Expect clearing and change. As your facade crumbles and your walls come tumbling down, the true illumination of self bursts through!\r"
