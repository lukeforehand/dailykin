Yellow Warrior is the grace of the descent of the dove. Embody the mystic gift of trust in direct guidance. Through trust, you journey to the place of 'no time' and limitless light. There you will undergo the transformations to embody solar heart and mind.","Yellow Warrior is a conduit for cosmic communication, offering access to the universal web of consciousness. This is the web of the Mayan mystic spider that weaves intergalactic threads, the conduit of interconnected consciousness. Yellow Warrior is the spider in the web, the grid connection for divine communication. Receive these ripples of knowing from Yellow Warrior's web through the central axis in your spine, your staff. Accept this gift of knowing in grace, as you would receive the morning light by turning your face to the Sun. Grace is an unexpected touch, a blessing given in love, a natural gift from the universe. Use the power of love like an electrical current to serve the light. Open fully to feel and receive it!The number for Yellow Warrior is sixteen, the number of unity with the cosmic foundation of resonant evolution. As you embody the ferryman's staff, you become anchored in your connection to cosmic consciousness. Holding within you the foundational steps of the trinity, you carry the \"Christed one\" into the world. As a living mystic, you are the conduit of the spiraling galaxies that creates a union with cosmic consciousness. Sixteen may also be seen as the beginning of another octave - a higher octave characterized by organic balance and the new Earth under your feet.","Yellow Warrior's colours are indigo and gold, combining the limitlessness of the night sky with the freedom of the daytime Sun. If you desire to access grace and trust, focus on these colours. ","Yellow Warrior is also your Higher Self & Guide.(you are guided by your own power doubled)","In Yellow Warrior's star-glyph, notice the three sets of three pillars. There are many symbologies connected with this. For one, the three groups may represent stargates - access points between dimensions or 'holes between worlds.' Stargates such as Sirius and Pleiades are two such interstellar doorways that serve as entry points for many starseeded beings from other galaxies. Yellow Warrior acts as keeper of the wisdom of these stargates. In meditation with Yellow Warrior, you can learn how to utilize these stargates.","In the Cabalistic tradition, these pillars represent the three different paths toward cosmic consciousness. The pillar on the left is the path of the mind, the intellectual flowering of knowledge unfolding. The pillar on the right is the path of the heart, celebration, the feeling senses, passion and nature. The central pillar is the 'middle way,' the golden path that unifies heart and mind through divine devotion and service. This golden pillar ignites the flame in your heart and reveals cosmic knowledge.","This central pillar or path is called the chutz, or 'arrow' that is designed to carry you directly toward reunion with cosmic consciousness. The bow is a rainbow, representing Spirit's promise that your arrow will always be sustained through trust - even through seemingly dark times - in its movement toward home. This pillar symbolizes your embodiment, the choice to bring heaven to Earth as you dedicate your life to being an instrument of Spirit. Yellow Warrior is a composite energy created by those who serve this understanding. This mystical intelligence has its own spiritual identity and autonomy. As an archetype, it is the cosmic power of the planetary servers themselves, united in fulfilling divine purpose.","Those on the path of the central pillar paradoxically 'give all to attain no-thing.' This path is the eternal question for which there is no obvious answer: \"What is the no-thing? How can I be, yet not be?\" When this question is asked in an attitude of openness or prayer, the spiral symbol in the center of the glyph is activated. This spiral represents the eternal enigma of human existence, the cosmic question mark. It is the cry from the heart that says, \"Guide my footsteps in the perfect pattern of my being, into the mysteries of deeper understanding and wisdom. I am the song seeking the root of truth.\"","Trust in guidance is an essential attitude in accessing the position of the central pillar. Trust in Spirit to provide all you need, and trust that what is given will serve your highest evolution. Trust in the wisdom of the \"Mind of Light curriculum.\" Trust in your inner voice, your feelings, your moment-by-moment guidance. This is Spirit's clear confirmation. Trust as an open vehicle for Spirit, your mystical intelligence, your divine guidance. Embody your ability to commune with cosmic intelligence.","A universal symbol associated with Yellow Warrior is the ferryman's staff. This staff is a tangible expression of your truth - the ideas, concepts and spiritual creations that come out of your mystical discovery process. To the Maya, the ferryman is personified as Quetzalcoatl or Kukulkan, and the staff is a connecting point between the Earth plane and the Divine. Whether you view your spine as the staff of Yellow Warrior or as a metaphor for a staff that stands apart from you, a profound awareness can emerge from working with it. Direct guidance, communication, and embodiment are the key concepts contained in the staff. It is a symbol of learning to stand in your full power and authority - learning to 'tune in' to galactic intelligence so that transmissions are received effortlessly. This resonance is created through embodying light. The ferryman is offering you his staff. Plant it within yourself so that it becomes a blossoming tree of consciousness.","Red Serpent is your Subconscious Self and Hidden Helper.","\"I am the flint and tinder of the sacred fire,\" reads the meditation for Red Serpent. In the Great Mystery, flint and tinder represent the instinctive combustion that initiates movement in the physical body toward union with Spirit. When flint and tinder are brought together, the spark of divinity awakens and ignites the fire of your essence. Red Serpent invites the purifying spark of the sacred fire, the kundalini, to align and integrate your body, mind and spirit. Red Serpent can help you uncover apparent blockages in specific chakras to clear an align them. If you are working on a process of purification, invite Red Serpent to assist you.Red Serpent's symbol is the serpent, representing healing and wholeness. This Mayan medicine can remove toxins, rejuvenate and transform dis-ease. Red Serpent is also known by the Maya as the kultanlilni, or kundalini, the energy that moves up from the base of the spine and out through the crown chakra. There are two aspects of this force, the ida and the pingala, representing its male and female polarities. One of the ancient secrets of Red Serpent is the activation of higher states of consciousness through balancing these two polarities so that they dance within us as one. Another metaphor for this serpent energy comes from the Mayan words luk umen tun ben can, or \"those absorbed by the serpent of the sacred knowledge.\" When the seven chakras are fully activated, one experiences an enlightened state.","Red Serpent represents the basic structural apparatus of your motivations, instincts, desires, and your innate movement toward wholeness. Red Serpent asks you to shed the skin of your past and step into the fires of alchemical transmutation. In this, rebirth is revealed. This desire is an innate response encoded in the depths of your being.","With the energy of Red Serpent, you learn to use the innate intelligence of the body. In this culture you may have become separated from this wisdom. It works like this: when you suppress and ignore your issues, your body receives and retains the unconscious metaphors of that which is ignored. This may be expressed through physical symptoms that bring your unconscious issues to conscious awareness. When this happens, work toward a more conscious relatonship with your body - and work with the physical metaphors in order to heal yourself on all levels.","The body has a specific kind of consciousness through which messages are clearly delivered. In fact, the body itself is a living metaphor that mirrors your mind, emotions and spirit. However, the body also remembers all it has experienced, and consequently holds the consciousness of the past within it, including past wounds and traumas. In healing these, remember the innocence of your body. Treat it with love and respect. Open yourself to be aware of its messages and metaphors rather than storing them. Be willing to look at the positive intent beneath any symptoms or physical process your body is using to communicate. Explore whatever it may be asking you to see.","In this alignment process, you can use images or energies that come to you in meditation or dreams. Journey through your body to catalyze and explore any sensations, colors, shapes, or images. In these times we have a profound opportunity to transcend both our physical and our spiritual genetics. The body's integration provides an unparalleled opportunity for personal evolution. Learn to expand and utilize your senses to access your body's wisdom and vitality. Don't 'think' about it; simply allow your body to sense intuitively the solutions necessary for change and growth.","Red Serpent also represents the connection between powerful physical/ecstatic experiences and the light of higher consciousness. This is an initiation of awakening through the body and senses, rather than in negation of them. As Jose Arguelles says in The Mayan Factor, \"Like the Maya, we shall understand that the path to the stars is through the senses.\" Within the body are held the keys to fully awakening our consciousness. This deeper understanding is expressed in tantric practices, where spirituality and sexuality are integrated and honoured as a means to enlightenment. Red Serpent represents the integration of mind, body and spirit.","Red Serpent is associated with the sacred tools of the drum and the rattle. Drums and rattles can break down old patterns or bring energy into alignment.","White World-Bridger represents your Challenge and Gift. With maturity and awareness this challenge will turn into a Focus. This is what you desire to learn in this lifetime.If you find yourself disturbed by or denying any painful processes, be willing to look at how you might embrace death. Death is a natural part of transformation. Sometimes we are brought to experience symbolic deaths such as loss, divorce, illness, or separation from others. Embrace these seemingly dark or difficult experiences; they will release you from attachments and expectations, clearing you to more fully receive the light. If you find yourself in a dark corner of depression or despair, White World-Bridger offers you a lifeline, a way out. Allow your burdens to be lifted into the sweet release and forgiveness of White World-Bridger. Don't give up. There is always someone somewhere who can help you. Reach out to a friend, a loved one, a therapist. Know that you are comforted and supported in love's unconditional embrace.Another shadow of White World-Bridger is the desire to be in control, which can move into fear of death. This fear may be expressed as an imbalance in your physical, mental or emotional well-being, or as an exaggerated focus on the body, health, money or addictive activities. Look at the consequences and possibilities that would be presented by your symbolic death. The transformation offered in White World-Bridger is found in surrender, release and forgiveness. Through awareness and clear intention, old patterns can magically shift, offering you a loving hand that shows a new way.","Blue Night is your Compliment - something that comes naturally to you.Blue night is the dark mystery within, the journey into self, that place to which you can always retreat to garner the gifts of your process subjectively. You are being asked to enter into and explore your process subjectively. Blue Night is the immense field of potential found in the depths of human emotion and feeling. The touch of Blue Night is like the moment you crawl into bed and feel yourself surrounded by warmth, darkness and peace.","Blue Night's abyss holds the potent evolutionary playing field of all possibility. Here, as in the aboriginal dreamtime, there are no distinctions between then and now, real or imagined, dream or dreamer. In this expanded field, all things are not only possible but are constantly in the process of creation. In the framework of dreamtime, limiting constructs of \"ordinary reality\" such as time, space, and linear causality are freed into an expanded system, with unlimited access to ALL realities.","Dreamtime holds powerful opportunities. It is a field where potential, past, and future are held in the same matrix as the present moment. If such a construct is foreign to you, stretch your mind and entertain the possibility that you could help to dream a different reality into being. Enter into the mystery where reality is actually created.","In becoming a conscious dreamer, you can assist in literally creating a new reality for yourself, as well as constributing to the larger dream that is emerging. By focusing on this creation, your thoughts and intentions are projected at superluminal speeds across the crystal grid network that encompasses universes. This energetic field seeds, supports, and empowers the creation of an unfolding reality.","At a certain point, when a critical threshold of energy has been focused on a clear intent such as world peace, the underlying constructs of reality shift and a new reality begins filtering into human experience. Make no mistake: great change is seeded by conscious dreamers who understand and know that they are co-creating the larger dream.","Among other things, the dreamfield will bring to the surface your psychological polarities and core issues. These are the belief constructs you learn from society and experience, such as likes and dislikes, values and attitudes. You naturally attract the situation that promises integration, but through conditioning and habitual behaviour, you may choose to compensate, staying in a fixed pattern to protect your position. This choice will create only momentary relief, because the issues will keep being drawn back to be integrated. Thus, you may often find whatever is blocked or hidden manifesting into your consciousness through a dream, a body symptom, or a relationship. Often you may resist the new and the unknown. You may avoid going over your \"growth edge\", because it may be asking for a shift in your underlying belief structures. Yet profound growth is possible through working with this charged material. Through following it into the darkness, you bring into the dreamfield the light that will carry you to wholeness and fulfillment.","In working with the growth edge in your dreamfield, often it is important to catalyze enough energy to free the stuckness and fixed patterns. By following or amplifying the feeling, your increased awareness will lead to the root of the issue thas has been separated from consciousness. Hidden within the unused channels of your perception are clues to the mystery that will integrate and release the restrictive pattern.","A meditation for Blue Night is, \"I am the darkness that is the light and the stillness that is the dancing.\" This meditation perfectly describes the paradoxical energy of Blue Night, the place of darkness from which all light emanates, the no-form abyss that contains all possibility. In finding this still point of Blue Night, you can access any expression of the light. The energy of Blue Night simply asks you to be still, to allow that expression to take shape from the darkness. From the darkness of Blue Night emerges the Essence Self. Sit in stillness, embracing the journey of insight and integration.","The colour of Blue Night is black, which represents the womb of the larger self, the receptive condition necessary to receive the light fully. Black is also an access route to the wisdom of the unconscious, the mystery of the abyss where you can tap into the collective dreamfield for insight and creative ideas. Blue Night also includes the shades of gray, symbolic of the merging of light with the darkness. If you wish to work with the energy of Blue Night, visualize black.","Your Tone is Tone 11 - Spectral Change, disintegration, letting go, stripping away, complexity moving to simplicity.Eleven is the ray of dissonance, the foundation of self combined with the foundation of Essence Self, catalyzed by the point of unity. Eleven is the process of disintegration, stripping away the layers down to your core essence. Unity, the great illuminator, is transforming patterns and structures, freeing you from things that no longer serve your emerging wholeness. Look through the surface appearance of your process. Let complexity dissipate, becoming the blessing of simplicity.With the Spectral Tone of 11, cherished ideals, beliefs, and images of all kinds are being brought up for you to reexamine, illuminate, and transform. Examine what appears dissonant in your life. Let go! Embrace the disintegration process without resisiting or judging it. The rigid walls of your resistances are being broken down. Going through your resistances and boundaries prepares a space for greater wisdom. You are becoming an open system. Anything that defines you is being stripped away. Expect clearing and change. As your facade crumbles and your walls come tumbling down, the true illumination of self bursts through!"]},"calendar":{"galactic":"5","guided":"Intelligence","moon":{"image":"https://spacestationplaza.com/images/moons/moon_lq.gif","name":"Last Quarter","percent":"50.3%"}}}
