It is the cornucopia, the paradox of emptiness and harvest, the still place that lies open and fallow, receiving the gifts.","Yellow Human offers you the gift of beginner's mind in the fullness of union. Be receptive. Yellow Human is preparing your circuits for transformation. Become empty, that your thirst may be quenched by the bounteous gifts poured from the chalice of the spiralling galaxies. Open and receive all that Yellow Human offers in the chalice of your own body.","Eb asks you to strengthen and clear your physical vessel in order to prepare for the expanded energies of higher mind. Your chalice of self is being purified through vibrational adjustments in the brain/body system. With this quickening, adjustments are made and your circuits of consciousness are naturally transformed. Often this process is accompanied by the sensation of being altered or \"rewired\". Higher centers of the brain and the light-sensitive pineal and pituitary glands are being activated to contain more light. This penetration brings you to a critical threshold, creating enormous change at the cellular level. It also activates soul memories and expands your concepts of reality.","With this expanded consciousness, your brain/body system is being cleared and fine-tuned so that you can create a sluiceway for the activation and acceleration of cosmic consciousness. This penetration of frequencies and its accompanying quickening is like upgrading the 'hard drive' of your biocomputer and activating the 'hidden chip,' the unused parts of your brain.","This is the foundation and awakening of your light body, a body crafted from the expansion of interstellar light within every cell. This body exists in and out of time and space and is able to experience and communicate freely with other dimensions and times. This is the resonant body within those whom Jose Arguelles calls the Servant-Warriors: \"those humans who fully realize the dream light body within the physical body and understand the circuitry of the human organism - who use the light body to navigate the electromagnetic waters which we call the universe.\"","The development of the light body involves strong interaction between Spirit and self as you prepare for entrance into the expanded chalice of Essence Self. In preparing this vessel, you enter into the rites of passage inherent to cosmic consciousness, and such rites eventually burst any false containers of self that cannot encompass the expanding chalice.","In meditation, expand to include all that you are. Then bring that feeling of expansion back into your physical self. In this process, you create a complex stability, opening a chalice of self that is fully rooted in human form. With this expansion, you are freed to explore within a new center that, paradoxically, seems to have to center. Yellow Human reveals the secret of being essence within form, everywhere and nowhere, \"nothing\" but present in all things.","The metaphor of the ever-expanding chalice is a powerful spiritual tool. This chalice represents the eternal container of light, ever filled with spirit's fire and nourishment. It is the metaphor that represents the form in which your full potential can manifest. Each stage in your journey feels like the final one, but each stage then opens to an expanded form, releasing you into the next stage of consciousness.","All the gifts of the macrocosm pour out of the universal cornucopia. With an open heart, empty yourself to be filled with the fruits of your true desire. Through the temple of your body, lift the chalice of your expanded self and declare that it is filled with truth and clarity. Feel the ecstatic union with your full potential as a human being.","Meditate on the cornucopia with you at its center. Lift the chalice of your self-generated energy vortex to greet the vortex that will descend from above. As an open vessel, prepare a place to receive Yellow Human's gifts. When you flow in unconditional love, all the fruits of the universe rush toward you for benediction.","Bathe in love's essence as a child splashing in a pool on a hot day. Connect with others in joyous union. Use the broom of Yellow Human to sweep your day clear of past experiences and the issues and obstacles of small mind. In the spirit of Yellow Human function on all frequencies and power bands. Your cup is filled with the nectar of sacramental union. Be fulfilled by the great harvest of love! ","Yellow Human is also your Higher Self & Guide.(you are guided by your own power doubled)The harmonic wisdom of Yellow Human is resonance, the quality of sounding again. When you strike a tuning fork, another tuning fork next to it will begin to resonate in response because of its similar vibrational makeup and structural attunement. When you are being the vibration of all that you are, a natural resonance is set up for your chalice to be filled and your world to become fully resonant.Be attuned to higher vibrational frequencies through such practices as meditation, yoga, prayer, changing, song, dance and sacred movement.All physical matter produces vibrations that are not detectable by the human ear. The human brain creates waves or resonant frequencies in the alpha range that vibrate with those of the planet (at about 7.8 hertz per second). The fundamental harmonic frequency of planet Earth is similar to the brain-wave harmonic of a meditative person. The main reason meditators experience feelings of well-being is because they are tuned into a power source greater than themselves!The musical descriptor that typifies Yellow Human is ripieno, which means 'filling up' or 'filling in the harmony.' As you become empty and still, Yellow Human offers a receptive environment to resonate with you. Being empty is as simple as being present in the moment. In emptiness you become open to being filled with harmony and light.","Red Moon is your Subconscious Self and Hidden Helper.","Red Moon is the cosmic seed of awakened awareness. Consume it like a fruit, and let it blossom within you. You are on the quest of self-remembrance, of Godseed. If you work with the energy of Red Moon with clear awareness and attention, an awakened state of remembrance will naturally blossom within you. Remembrance means having direct access to your expanded presence through an intrinsic perception of unity. Remembrance is your recognition of the larger pattern and your connection to it, often facilitated through dreams, art, music, colors and creative pursuits. With focused attention, meditate on Red Moon and you will receive help with self-remembrance.","Red Moon is also a beacon or transmitting station. As you open to self-remembrance, you become a beacon and receiver for cosmic consciousness. This communication creates the gradual opening of the third eye, the eye within the mononlith of self. As this eye opens and your communication becomes more refined, you will notice more signs, signals and understanding coming to you. These are all for your growth and evolution - a feedback system from which you can gain insight about your journey.","The number for Red Moon is 9, which symbolizes the recurrence of great cycles. An example of such recurrence is the periodic return of master teachers to help awaken human beings on Earth. Nine is the number of Quetzalcoatl, buddha, and Christ. Red Moon is a symbol for great teachers who have come to translate univeresal wisdom to humanity, to embody the awakened state of consciousness that is accessible to all. Such teachers serve as a connection to the Divine and hold the promise of full self-mastery. ","Take off the veil of forgetfulness. Become the beacon of awakened awareness. As you open to self-remembrance, you will freely receive divine guidance. Be with others who support your fullest expression. ","White Wind represents your Challenge and Gift. With maturity and awareness this challenge will turn into a Focus. This is what you desire to learn in this lifetime.In the shadow of White Wind, you may doubt yoru oneness with the Source, feeling that divinity is outside yourself. Not realizing your ability to respond as a co-creator of your reality, you may tend to leave everything up to Spirit. Yet you are Spirit, so it is up to you! If you are waiting, feeling separated from inspiration, attract it through the clarify of your own spiritual intent. Call it forth to manifest in your life.Being aligned and unifed with Spirit, imagine yourself being infused and purified, clearing your neural circuitry with the frequency of White Wind. The transformation held in this shadow can be found in experiencing the inspiration of Spirit, no matter how sublt your perception of it is. Follow your innate guidance. Act on inspiration as it comes to you, without analyzing it. And remember: the breath of Spirit can be as subtle as a fragrance in a breeze. Learn to sense and experience it.Another indication of the shadow of White Wind is feeling constrained by the forms and idioms of organized groups or religions. If you're in this shadow, alarms may go off when you hear words like ceremony, ritual, archetype, heaven, or God. In the Mayan system, words are held in a larger context than is implied in ordinary usage. The word heaven, for example, denotes a particular vibrational frequency and harmonic resonance. There are probably many forms of meditation, ceremony, prayer, and other practices that could serve your spiritual evolution. Appreciate the truth in all forms! Be willing to look at subconscious programs that may impair the experience of forms that do serve your spiritual unfoldment. Consciously release judgments, resentments, or hidden wounds you may have about organized groups and religionns and their participants or practices.Learn to sense and experience your connection with the Divine by acting on inspiration as it comes to you.*in the Mayan Oracle, book, below - there are 3 great Breath Meditations for White Wind*","Blue Hand is your Compliment - something that comes naturally to you.Blue Hand is a gateway, an opening, a portal from one understanding to another. A clue to the meaning of Blue Hand is found in the meditation, \"I am, by thinly veiled design, the threshold to other dimensions. In my ending is my beginning. The initatory gateway awaits.\" Blue Hand is the seventh or last archetype in the cycle of development of primary being. It represents the power found in completion. Blue Hand is seen as a closure, which is really an opening to another level of being.","Like the fluidity of moving water, Blue Hand is associated with the process of dance, mudra, and beauty. This movement is a metaphor for the ebb and flow of life. In meditation with Manik, experience the flowing quality that is the beauty of the cosmic dance. Remember this essence and this fluidity at times when your life feels most inflexible or lacking in beauty.","Blue Hand represents the 'beauty way', the ability to see intrinsic beauty within yourself and in all things. Living the beauty way requires being in your full beauty and power. From this place, your self-authority naturally flows. This is the position where your ego is aligned with divine will. When you are standing in your full beauty and power, your very presence invites others to be all that they are. To the Maya, Blue Hand represents the deer, the gentle, serenely aware guide who walks in fluid beauty and grace, opening and revealing.","The energy of Blue Hand will also help you to manifest spiritual skills - especially those intuitive gifts such as oracular divination. In each incarnation, you bring certain gifts. Each path - from priest and priestess to shaman and dancer to artist and gardener - carries varied tools and skills. You have chosen certain gifts and tools that offer you a way to interact with others and your life process. This may be as simple as calling on your innate wisdom and insight in order to see clearly the gifts and tools that you carry.","Your Tone is Tone 11 - Spectral Change, disintegration, letting go, stripping away, complexity moving to simplicity.Eleven is the ray of dissonance, the foundation of self combined with the foundation of Essence Self, catalyzed by the point of unity. Eleven is the process of disintegration, stripping away the layers down to your core essence. Unity, the great illuminator, is transforming patterns and structures, freeing you from things that no longer serve your emerging wholeness. Look through the surface appearance of your process. Let complexity dissipate, becoming the blessing of simplicity.With the Spectral Tone of 11, cherished ideals, beliefs, and images of all kinds are being brought up for you to reexamine, illuminate, and transform. Examine what appears dissonant in your life. Let go! Embrace the disintegration process without resisiting or judging it. The rigid walls of your resistances are being broken down. Going through your resistances and boundaries prepares a space for greater wisdom. You are becoming an open system. Anything that defines you is being stripped away. Expect clearing and change. As your facade crumbles and your walls come tumbling down, the true illumination of self bursts through!"]},"calendar":{"galactic":"23","guided":"Free Will","moon":{"image":"https://spacestationplaza.com/images/moons/moon_fq.gif","name":"First Quarter","percent":"35.4%"}}}
