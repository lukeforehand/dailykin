## About

### GALACTIC MOON 8 - Modeling * Integrity * Harmonize

Name of the Moon (Galactic) and the Action (Modeling), Essence (Integrity), and Power (Harmonize) associated with the moon.

### Galactic Tone Symbol - Solar Seal Symbol

Galactic Tone and Solar Seal.

13 Galactic Tones and 20 Solar Seals describe the process of cosmic creation.  The 13 Galactic Tones are represented by dots and bars.  The Solar Seal can be understood as an archetype or behavior pattern.

The Galactic Tones can be thought of as radio-pulses that are akin to the pulsations of radio waves from the dense core of the pulsar or quasar. The Solar Seals represent the cycle of frequency-range possibilities for transformation or evolution that each of these radio-pulses may undergo.
